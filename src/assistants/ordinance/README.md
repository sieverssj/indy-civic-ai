# Ordinances Assistant

We'll start with one assistant that can answer questions of Municipal Ordinances. It leverages the [Municode Website for Indianpolis - Marion County, IN](https://library.municode.com/in/indianapolis_-_marion_county/codes/code_of_ordinances)

The Assistant was manually created here: https://platform.openai.com/assistants/asst_Ro2w1A8EZ0PXc1WaUdh9mfhi

## Functions

This assistant implements 2 functions: `search_municipal_code` and `get_municipal_code`. These function implementations are backed by the (undocumented) Municode API.

### search_municipal_code

`search_municipal_code` relies on calls like `GET https://api.municode.com/search?clientId=2720&contentTypeId=CODES&fragmentSize=200&isAdvanced=false&isAutocomplete=false&mode=CLIENTMODE&pageNum=1&pageSize=10&searchText=<search text>&sort=0&stateId=14&titlesOnly=false` where the `searchText` query param contains the search phrase generated by the assistant.

### get_municipal_code

`get_municipal_code` relies on calls like `GET https://api.municode.com/CodesContent?isAdvancedSearch=false&jobId=451186&nodeId=<node id>&productId=12016` where `nodeId` is an identifier returned in the `search_municipal_code` results.
